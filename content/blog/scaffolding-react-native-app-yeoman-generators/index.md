At [Instawork](https://instawork.com/) I built a CLI to scaffold new modules for our React Native apps (as a hackathon project). This module was used to scaffold screens, redux modules (actions, reducers, selectors, sagas) and services. It would also update the root files with the updated imports.

This reduced a developer's time a lot for building new features. With the CLI in place, all the initial manual refactoring and copy paste work was replaced by a single command.
