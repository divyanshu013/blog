At [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/) I recently had a chance to write a RFC for Blade, our open source cross platform design system, to design our approach towards layouts with my team _([RFC PR](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/pull/950))_.

This RFC outlines layout primitives and components in Blade. It covers the proposed components, APIs along with prior art and alternatives considered.

**Read more** on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/razorpay/blade/blob/master/rfcs/2023-01-06-layout.md).
